# GRAPH THEORY
## Project 2017

### Introduction

This repository contains a database design document and a graph database prototype for a third-year undergraduate project for the module Graph Theory. The module is taught to undergraduate students at GMIT in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Ian McLoughlin.

### Overview

GMIT uses a database to store timetabling information. Courses, modules, different venues, are some of the pieces of information required to build a timetable. The main goal of this project is to design and implement, through a small prototype, a different way of store such data by using a Graph database called [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/product/). To do so a Database Design Document is required in order to explain and detail what information needs to be stored, why is that information needed, what assumptions are made, contrains...

The project was guided by the following excerpt from the project instructions:
> The minimum standard for this project is a GitHub repository containing
a document detailing the design of the database and a prototype Neo4j
database following that design and using data from GMIT.
The document should clearly state what data needs to be stored by a
timetabling system, and how that data is to be represented in the database.
This means that you must clearly specify the design choices you have made
as to what data are represented as nodes, relationships, labels, relationship
types or properties. It should also specify, and give examples of, Cypher
queries for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting data.
The prototype database must contain data from GMIT’s own timetabling
system, in the structure set out in your design document. The data can be
copied or scraped from GMIT’s timetabling website, or otherwise obtained.
You should include, as a separate section in your design document, how you
obtained the data in your prototype database.
